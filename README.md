# Conquest

This is an Amiga TUI game that I've modernized and ported to Linux.

The gameplay is unchanged. You can switch to the `original` tag to get
to the original sources.

I still don't know how to play, and there are probably bugs. But at
least it builds!

Original Fish disk notes:

```
There are two executables provided here:

	conquest.orig	Executable received from Bob Shimbo with the
			source disk.

	conquest	Executable built by me using my current
			Lattice 3.03 compiler and the supplied sources.

I have not attempted to determine why they are different sizes, or
if the size difference is significant.  The both run to the extent
that you can start them up and then "QUIT" successfully.
